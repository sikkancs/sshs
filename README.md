# SSHs â€“ Interactive SSH Menu for macOS

SSHs is a shell script + AWK tool that lets you quickly browse and connect to your SSH hosts using fzf.  
It is inspired by [trzsz-ssh](https://github.com/trzsz/trzsz-ssh) but avoids Go, using only shell and AWK, following the approach described in [How I manage SSH connections](https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2020/05/23/how-i-manage-ssh-connections/).

Works directly with your SSH config file (~/.ssh/config)


## Features
- Search through SSH hosts (entries in ~/.ssh/config)
- Two-column menu: Host name (with HostName) + Tags
- Preview: shows the SSH configuration for the selected host
- Key bindings:
    - Enter: Connect normally: ssh {host}
    - Ctrl+V: Connect in verbose mode: ssh -vvvv {host}
    - ?: Toggle preview (show host config)

## Installation on macOS

```bash
# Ensure you have fzf installed:
brew install fzf

# Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/sikkancs/sshs.git ~/.ssh/sshs

# Make scripts executable:**  
chmod +x ~/.ssh/sshs/sshs.sh
chmod +x ~/.ssh/sshs/sshs.awk

# Add an alias to your shell configuration (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc):
echo 'alias sshs="~/.ssh/sshs/sshs.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage
Run `sshs` in terminal.  
Run `sshs -h` for key bindings.
